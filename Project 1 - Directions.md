# A New Farmer's Guide to Managing a Fresh Cow Using College of the Ozarks' Protocols
   #### ***Introduction***
   
   For beginning dairy farmers in southwest Missouri, one of the first steps should be creating a fresh cow protocol for their area.  The College of the Ozarks' dairy has a specific protocol for taking care of cows before and after calving.  This protocol will be taken apart step by step to provide an understanding of why treatments are done in certain ways, and give new farmers ideas for thier own (if a different protocol is desired).  It is appropriate for the area and is simple to follow for new farmers.  This protocol is important because it determines the success of the cow after she calves. When a farm sets protocols into place, they will grow stronger calves and their cows will heal quickly after calving.   Applying udder comfort, administering oxytocin, taking temperature, and giving boluses are the steps that will be discussed in further detail.  These steps are put into place to ensure the College of the Ozarks' cows stay happy and healthy throughout their lives.

  There are different types of protocols that farms use depending on their location.  For southern Missouri, the changing climate and landscape require farmers to provide the essential nutrients that are not offered in the area through natural vegetation.  Without proper protocols set into place, cows could become ill and decrease their productive life.  College of the Ozarks’ protocol has been formulated by professional nutritionists and incorporates all the required nutrients for fresh dairy cows. 

## Pre-Calving

 - Apply udder comfort to the udder for 4 days prior to the cow’s due date. 
 
  There is only one step that occurs pre-calving; however, this step is extremely important.  Udder comfort is a blue rub that provides a relaxing feel to the udder.  This decreases the swelling that occurs pre-calving and allows the cow to produce higher milk yields earlier in her lactation.  
## Post-Calving
### Immediately after calving
#### Step 1
 - Apply udder comfort
 
Continue to apply udder comfort to ensure the cow is as comfortable as possible after calving. 

#### Step 2
 - Intramuscularly administer 3cc of oxytocin
 
Oxytocin is a hormone that induces milk letdown.  When a cow or heifer calves, she does not always produce enough oxytocin to fulfill her body’s need.  Farmers should give the cow this hormone shot because it will empty her udder of all the colostrum she produced for her calf to consume. 

#### Step 3
- Give 2 calcium boluses 

Using a specialized bolus gun, administer one bolus at a time to the cow.  Calcium boluses are given to supply calcium to the cow after she calves.  When a cow calves, all the calcium in her body goes straight to producing milk, leaving none for her regular body requirements.  This bolus assists in preventing milk fever in older cows and reducing somatic cell count levels in cows of all ages.

#### Step 4
- Give 1 BioFresh bolus 

Use a generic balling gun to administer the bolus to the cow.  Fresh cow boluses are given to cows because of the stress that the animal is going through during, and after calving.  The bolus is beneficial in three main ways. First, it supplies critical vitamins and minerals to supplement a cow’s variable intake.  Second, it maintains proper immune function by providing specialized proteins and microbial sugars; the yeast and enzymes in the bolus trigger a digestive response which boosts the cow’s immune system during this stressful time. Finally, the bolus aids in maintaining a low somatic cell count despite all the changes that are happening to the cow after freshening. 

#### Step 5
- Take the cow's temperature.

Insert a glass thermometer into the cow's rectum and hold for one minute.  Normal body temperature for dairy cows should be 101.5 degrees Fahrenheit.  A farmer should always check the cow's temperature because this is generally one of the first indicators of sickness.  Fresh cows are at risk of coming down with illnesses before or after calving with little physical signs.  When a farmer takes the cow's temperature, he is ultimately decreasing the chance of an unexpected illness.

## 12 hours post calving
#### Step 6
- 1cc oxytocin

When the cow is about to be milked for the second time after calving, she still is incapable of letting 100% of her milk down on her own due to swelling in her udder.  The dosage is reduced; however, still necessary for her to be properly milked out.  

## 24 hours post calving
#### Step 7
- 1 fresh cow bolus

After one full day post-calving, the cow is ready for her second BioFresh bolus.  The purpose of waiting 24 hours is to allow the first bolus to act.  By now, the first bolus has been used by the cow’s body. To boost her chances for a quick recovery and strengthen her immune system, a second bolus is essential.

# FAQ
1. Q: Can I skip a step if I’m rushed? 

A: Never skip steps! The protocol is designed for every step to be followed to ensure optimum success. 

2. Q: If the oxytocin doesn’t work, then what? 

A: Most of the time there are no issues with milk let-down using the shot.  If a cow refuses to let down her milk, simply try again in a few hours. By then, her natural hormones will become more alert again and she will have no problem letting it down on her own. 

3. Q: What if a bolus breaks before I administer it to the cow? 

A: The boluses are designed to slowly release inside the cow; therefore, if one breaks beforehand, the cow’s body would not be able to use the nutrients over a period of time.  It is important to store the boluses in a place where they will not become damaged. 

4. Q: Do any of the treatments require a milk withhold? 

A: None of the steps above require milk withholds; however, fresh cows do not need to go directly into the tank.  It is important to wait at least three days before milking a cow into the tank to ensure she has produced all of her colostrum and is now making normal milk.
