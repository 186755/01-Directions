# Intro
For beginning dairy farmers in southwest Missouri, one of the first steps should be creating a fresh cow protocol for their area.  The College of the Ozarks dairy has a specific protocol for taking care of cows before and after calving.  It is appropriate for the area and is simple to follow for new farmers.  This protocol is important because it determines in the success of the cow after she calves. When a farm sets protocols into place, they will grow stronger calves and their cows will heal quickly after calving.   Applying udder comfort, administering oxytocin, taking temperature, and giving boluses are the four steps that will be discussed.  These steps are put into place to ensure the College of the Ozarks cows stay happy and healthy throughout their lives.

 There are different types of protocols that farms use depending on their location.  For southern Missouri, the changing climate and landscape require farmers to provide the essential nutrients that are not offered in the area through natural vegetation.  Without proper protocols set into place, cows could become ill and decrease their productive life.  College of the Ozarks’ protocol has been formulated by professional nutritionists and incorporates all the required nutrients for fresh dairy cows. 

## Pre-Calving

 - Apply udder comfort to the udder for 4 days prior to the cow’s due date. 
 
There is only one step that occurs pre-calving; however, this step is extremely important.  Udder comfort is a blue rub that provides a relaxing feel to the udder.  This decreases the swelling that occurs pre-calving and allows the cow to produce higher milk yields earlier in her lactation.  
## Post-Calving
### Immediately after calving
#### Step 1
 - Apply udder comfort
 
Continue to apply udder comfort to ensure the cow is as relaxed as possible after calving. 

#### Step 2
 - Intramuscularly administer 3cc of oxytocin
 
Oxytocin is a hormone that induces milk letdown.  When a cow or heifer calves, she does not always produce enough oxytocin to fulfill her body’s need.  Farmers should give the cow this hormone shot because it will empty her udder of all the colostrum she produced for her calf to consume. 

#### Step 3
- Give 2 BioFresh calcium boluses 

#### Step 4
- Give 1 fresh cow bolus 

Use a generic balling gun to administer the bolus to the cow.  Fresh cow boluses are given to cows because of the stress that the animal is going through during, and after calving.  The bolus is beneficial in three main ways. First, it supplies critical vitamins and minerals to supplement a cow’s variable intake.  Second, it maintains proper immune function by providing specialized proteins and microbial sugars; the yeast and enzymes in the bolus trigger a digestive response which boosts the cow’s immune system during this stressful time. Finally, the bolus aids in maintaining a low somatic cell count despite all the changes that are happening to the cow after freshening. 

#### Step 5
- Take the cow's temperature.

Insert a glass thermometer into the cow's rectum and hold for one minute.  Normal body temperature for dairy cows should be 101.5 degrees Fahrenheit.  A farmer should always check the cow's temperature becuas ethis is generally one of the first indicators of sickness.  Fresh cows are at risk of coming down with illnesses before or after calving with little physical signs.  When a farmer takes the cow's temperature, he is ultimatly decresing the chance of an unexpected illness post-calving.  

## 12 hours post calving
#### Step 6
- 1cc oxytocin

## 24 hours post calving
#### Step 7
- 1 fresh cow bolus
