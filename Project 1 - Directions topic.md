### Proper proceedures for the care of a newborn calf and its mother.
I will be describing what takes place after a cow has her baby according to CofO protocols. I plan to go through the process of the cow and then the calf; then, tie them together in importance.  I want to explain that caring for them both properly is equally important for the animal's health in the future.
